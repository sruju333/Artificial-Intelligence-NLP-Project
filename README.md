# Artificial-Intelligence Project
### topics: Neural Networks, Natural Language Processing

This project aims to build an AI-driven predictive system that determines whether a newly posted question on Stack Overflow will be closed, as well as identifying the likely reason for closure. By addressing this issue, we can contribute to enhancing the communityâ€™s effectiveness and the quality of knowledge shared.
